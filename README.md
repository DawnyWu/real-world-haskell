real-world-haskell
==================

Parser for code samples from the book "real world haskell" (http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/).

It's written (of course) in haskell.

Code samples aren't complete for different reasons. For example: sometimes parts of the file are given not in ascending order. The goal of this repo is to allow easy access / reduce copy/pasting for the code written in the book.
